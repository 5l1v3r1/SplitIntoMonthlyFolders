# SplitIntoMonthlyFolders
A simple program which moves files into folders named for the date the file was last modified (YYYY_MM).

## Purpose

I had folders with 10,000+ and in some cases 100,000+ images and video recordings inside, recorded by Blue Iris years ago.  Folders with extremely high numbers of files are sometimes slow to work with, so I built this tool to automatically split the files into folders containing just one month of recordings each.

## Usage

Drag a single folder onto the executable, and all the files contained within the top level of the folder will be moved into subfolders named for the year and month the file was last modified.
